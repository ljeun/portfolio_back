overview: UX design for Enterprise IT solutions in the retail and mobility industry. Researched prior to business and designed end-to-end user experience.
description: I have designed user experiences or specific user interfaces on screens of digital products. In broader way, I did design activities to draw a solution or concept, such as journey map, ecosystem, and storyboard. As for more specific and the last actions, I designed screens for web or mobile with detail specifications. For example, I have designed a digital product - Nexshop for retail companies. I have used different kinds of tools such as Powerpoint, Balsamiq, Adobe, Sketch, and Invision.
