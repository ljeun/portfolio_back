role: Designer
overview: UX design for Enterprise IT solutions in the retail and mobility industry. Researched prior to business and designed end-to-end user experience.
description: I have designed user experiences for enterprise solutions, for example, <a href="https://www.samsungsds.com/global/en/solutions/off/nde/nexshop_digital_experience.html" class="link">Nexshop</a> for retail companies. Due to the privacy reasons, it is hard to show any specific visuals as a result, but in broader way, I did design activities from user research, concept design through design process of user journey map, ecosystem, and storyboard. As for more specific and the last actions, I designed screens for web or mobile with detail specifications. I have used different kinds of tools such as Powerpoint, Balsamiq, Adobe, Sketch, and Invision.
