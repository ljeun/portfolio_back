overview: Collection of little but big details of product/service design in my everyday life and travel.
description: I used to take pictures of good or bad UX designs for products/services after I learned UX and start to work for design a digital solutions (It was inspired by a book of "The design of everytday things" by Don Norman). Most of time, those were little detail things but made a big differences for people who use the product or service. Looking back, the images and thoughts behind those have been serving me to have a keen eye and good ideas, so I started to collect the pictures in a web page to remind and use for ideation or any other design activities whenever I needed.
