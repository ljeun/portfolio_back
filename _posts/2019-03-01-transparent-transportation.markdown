overview: An accessible app to divert some of the taxi orders for passengers (the specific user group as the visually impaired).
description: This project started with the problem which has a bottleneck in the information flow between users and Public Organizing taxi call center, resulting in long queues on the phone. Notably, the users were mostly those who have difficulties in riding general public transportation so need easy access to the taxi service. In this context, our solution was to provide an accessible mobile application which diverts some of the orders by the users from the phone queues. The app is firstly designed, targeting at the visually impaired.
