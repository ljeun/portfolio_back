subtitle: "Demola Project: <br/> Transparent Transportation "
type: Demola Project
period: 2019
period_detail: Jan.2018 - Mar.2019
role: User Research, UI Design, Prototyping (Sketch+Invision)
overview: An accessible app to divert some of the taxi orders for passengers (the specific user group as the visually impaired).
section_1: problem
content_1: There was a bottleneck in the information flow between users and public organizing taxi call center, resulting in long queues on the phone. Notably, the users were mostly those who have difficulties in riding general public transportation so need easy access to the taxi service.
section_2: Stakeholder/User Interviews
content_2: Many stakeholders have been found and interviewed in a wide range, including taxi driver, customer center employees, and different kinds of softwares in addition to the general users. Based on the interviews, stakeholder map was created, and our team was able to discover our team discovered a critical painpoint that there is no any system supporting connection or communication between users and drivers. It was not developed so far since the main users are the elderly or the ones who have a certain difficulties, but through user interviews, we also found many of users are using smart phone, although they use in their own different way, for example, using VoiceOver.
section_3: Accessible Mobile Application
content_3: The solution was to provide an accessible mobile application which diverts some of the orders by the users from the phone queues. The app was iteratively designed for the visually impaired for the first target user group. The first iteration with user interview/observation led three key features as voice-reading/recording, zooming, and visual accessibility. The visuals were carefully considered with font size and color contrast, especially to meet the criteria of WCAG 2.0 Guidelines as basics; the minimum color contrast ratio should be more than 4.5:1 and more than 7:1 for enhancement. The users also varied for different color dependency, so the different color combinations were optionally designed in the next iteration. The voice was also tested by users with the pre-recored human voice but the actual development was shortly tested by other team members.
