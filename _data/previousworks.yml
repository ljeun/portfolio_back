The team set with Business, Design, and Engineering Department of the school. We went through contents ideation and user research at the same time by visiting Association for the Visually Impaired. After defining the service concept with persona and user stories, I designed UI in details and iterated a few times with team discussion and feedback from others. Due to time limitation, the test with actual implemented feature was quite short, but I have learned so much how the actual service is created in wider views.
