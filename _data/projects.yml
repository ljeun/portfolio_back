    overview: An empirical design study with AR technology and gamification to encourage tourists' local food consumption.
    description: Local food is unfamiliar to travelers in new places, and it is a challenge that requires much time and effort to choose and find the information. Augmented Reality (AR) and gamification can derive a possibility to support travelers to consume local food. The benefits of MAR and gamification were explored through the design and evaluation of a gamified MAR application prototype to encourage travelers’ local food consumption. <br/> From user studies (observations, interviews and initial concept evaluation), tourists’ needs were identified, and UX goals were defined as adventure, autonomy, and competence as to what experiences the application provides. The goals guided the design and evaluation of a gamified MAR application. The application recognizes the real food through an AR mobile screen and displays basic food information with name/ingredient and 'food miles' which refers to how far the main ingredients come from the distance. Besides, gamification was applied for the users’ actions as collecting the food/ingredients and assigning levels according to how much local food a user consumed. <br/><br/> <a href="https://trepo.tuni.fi/handle/123456789/27605" class="link">Thesis Document (open access)</a>

-   title: "Demola Project: <br/> Transparent Transportation "
    type: Student-Company Project
    period: Jan.2018 - Mar.2019
    role: Designer
    overview: An accessible app to divert some of the taxi orders for passengers (the specific user group as the visually impaired).
    description: This project started with the problem which has a bottleneck in the information flow between users and Public Organizing taxi call center, resulting in long queues on the phone. Notably, the users were mostly those who have difficulties in riding general public transportation so need easy access to the taxi service. In this context, our solution was to provide an accessible mobile application which diverts some of the orders by the users from the phone queues. The app is firstly designed, targeting at the visually impaired.

-   title: Emission Detector
    type: Student work
    period: Oct.2017-Mar.2018
    role: Designer
    overview: Industrial project work with an emission company, Aeromon. I was involved in a user experience design and evaluation, ranging from defining UX goals to designing and evaluating the concept.
    description: Emission monitoring system was to detect, measure unexpected emissions and report the summary to decision-makers. The problem was that novice users (decision making persons) have difficulties to notice/analyze critical information in their current system. After the meeting with stakeholders, our team defined  four UX goals; ease of use, clarity, naturalness, and functionality against the problem. The following tasks are as below.<br/> -Analyzed the current system in detail in both pragmatic and hedonic ways; functionality, UI, User Flows. <br/> -Designed new concept with changed user flow, consistent UI elements.<br/> -Visualized screens in accordance with the new concept.<br/> -Worked interactive prototype to see how it works by actions.<br/> -Evaluated the prototype with two evaluation methods; AttrakDiff and ASQ( After-Scenario-Questionnaire) <br/><br/> It was the most difficult to consider the completely different group of users. Since the users include both technical engineers and the decision-makers like the administrative head of officer, there were huge gaps between them for the familarity and proficiency with the system. However, the most significant data was the same, which allowed us to focus on that view.

    overview: Collection of little but big details of product/service design in my everyday life and travel.
    description: I used to take pictures of good or bad UX designs for products/services after I learned UX and start to work for design a digital solutions (It was inspired by a book of "The design of everytday things" by Don Norman). Most of time, those were little detail things but made a big differences for people who use the product or service. Looking back, the images and thoughts behind those have been serving me to have a keen eye and good ideas, so I started to collect the pictures in a web page to remind and use for ideation or any other design activities whenever I needed.

# -   title: Debator
#     type: Student Work
#     period: Oct.2017-Dec.2017
#     role: Designer
#     overview: Debate application design for my classmate's hobby. I designed app icon and screens with graphical user interface(GUI), using Sketch, Craft Manager plugin, Invision.
#     description: One of my classmate is in debate club as an hobby. The club members have high barriers to start a debate in every club meeting; selecting topic, setting time, and assigning participants, which is depressing their motivation. In this context, we tried to make a 'Debator' application to solve the problems. The goal was to make debates inclusive and engaging at all times. We developed conceptual model in order and build a navigation model through DoGo map. we designed inital wireframe and updated several times with team discussion and feedback from others. For the last step, I designed icons, color sets, and graphical user interfaces on screens. <br/> The challenging question was whether 3D touch is needed for users to stop(terminate) a time with one button of 'pause'. (normal tap;pause, 3D touch tap; stop) If then, how can we design for that? It could be still controversial but we concluded that using 3D touch could be useful once they notice and familiar with the action. In the future, it will need to evalaute more specific usability issues regarding this when the application is actually implemented.

# -   title: AR Mobile Game on the Ride
#     type: Student Work
#     period: Oct.2017-Dec.2017
#     role: Designer
#     overview: A concept design work of multimodal interaction. I planned and designed interactions of different modalities.
#     description: This is AR mobile game application for bus users, which aims to experience their rides more joyful and meaningful. Through gaze tracking and shake gesture interaction, users save their favorite buildings or nature elements in the city while riding a bus. With the collected items, the user can make their own city map in the application. I did quick prototype with paper and evaluated that using SUXES method for small group of people.
