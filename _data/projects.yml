-   title: Emission Detector
    type: Student work
    period: Oct.2017-Jan.2018
    role: Designer
    overview: Industrial project work with an emission company, Aeromon. I was involved in a user experience design and evaluation, ranging from defining UX goals to designing and evaluating the concept
    description: Emission monitoring system was to detect, measure unexpected emissions and report the summary to decision-makers. The problem was that novice users (decision making persons) have difficulties to notice/analyze critical information in their current system. After the meeting with stakeholders, our team defined  four UX goals; ease of use, clarity, naturalness, and functionality against the problem. The following tasks are as below.<br/> -Analyzed the current system in detail in both pragmatic and hedonic ways; functionality, UI, User Flows. <br/> -Designed new concept with changed user flow, consistent UI elements.<br/> -Visualized screens in accordance with the new concept.<br/> -Worked interactive prototype to see how it works by actions.<br/> -Evaluated the prototype with two evaluation methods; AttrakDiff and ASQ( After-Scenario-Questionnaire)
    <br/> It was the most difficult to consider the completely different group of users. Since the users include both technical engineers and the decision-makeing officers like Administrative head of officer, there were huge gaps between them for the familarity and proficiency with the system. However, the most significant data was the same, which makes us to focus on the view.

-   title: Debator
    type: Student work
    period: Oct.2017-Dec.2017
    role: Designer
    overview: Debate application design for my classmate's hobby. I designed app icon and screens with graphical user interface(GUI), using Sketch, Craft Manager plugin, Invision.
    description: One of my classmate is in debate club as an hobby. The club members have high barriers to start a debate in every club meeting; selecting topic, setting time, and assigning participants, which is depressing their motivation. In this context, we tried to make a 'Debator' application to solve the problems. The goal was to make debates inclusive and engaging at all times. We developed conceptual model in order and build a navigation model through DoGo map. we designed inital wireframe and updated several times with team discussion and feedback from others. For the last step, I designed icons, color sets, and graphical user interfaces on screens. <br/> The challenging question was whether 3D touch is needed for users to stop(terminate) a time with one button of 'pause'. (normal tap;pause, 3D touch tap; stop) If then, how can we design for that? It could be still controversial but we concluded that using 3D touch could be useful once they notice and familiar with the action. In the future, it will need to evalaute more specific usability issues regarding this when the application is actually implemented.

-   title: AR Mobile Game on the Ride
    type: Student work
    period: Oct.2017-Dec.2017
    role: Designer
    overview: A concept design work of multimodal interaction. I planned and designed interactions of different modalities.
    description: This is AR mobile game application for bus users, which aims to experience their rides more joyful and meaningful. Through gaze tracking and shake gesture interaction, users save their favorite buildings or nature elements in the city while riding a bus. With the collected items, the user can make their own city map in the application. I did quick prototype with paper and evaluated that using SUXES method for small group of people.
