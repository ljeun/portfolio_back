# Personal Portfolio

A simple portfolio page.

I have customized the theme from [https://github.com/mattcouchman/jekyll-resume](https://github.com/mattcouchman/jekyll-resume) for my purpose and works.


To customize this more, you need to fill or change the file..
 * `_config.yml` for basic settings.
 * `.yml` files in `_data` directory for details of your works, experience.
 * `.scss` files in `_sass` directory for styles on your own.
